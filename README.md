# circosBlastSimilarities

A simple script to draw a [circos](http://www.circos.ca/) plot with blast similarities between genomic segments (potential segmental duplications) within a chromosome.

Other plots, like RNA-seq coverage, can be added.

Just modify `make_circos.py` and `circos.conf`, and run the script with `python make_circos.py`.
