# The chromosomes_unit value is used as a unit (suffix "u") to shorten
# values in other parts of the configuration file. Some parameters,
# such as ideogram and tick spacing, accept "u" suffixes, so instead of

# spacing = 10000000
#
# you can write
#
# spacing = 10u
#
# See ticks.conf for examples.
